These notes are about the code in the TI Connect Source

`com.ti.et.elg.connectServer.factory.ConnectServerFactory` can be very useful for communicating with devices.
See files like `com.ti.et.elg.commonUISupport.sendToHandheldDialog.SendToHandheldDialog` for example.

Especially `com.ti.et.elg.connectServer.exports.TIDevice` for device information.

TODO:
Find a way to hack into that system to use it in a custom app.
